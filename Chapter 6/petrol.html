<!--Petrol Calculator ☑️
Create a simple petrol calculator. Your petrol calculator must include:

A field for the user the enter the cost of petrol per liter. This should have a default value of 1.72
A field for the user to enter the number of liters purchased. This should have a default value of 0
A button that when clicked calculates the total cost of the petrol purchased and displays the result to the screen
A p tag to display the total cost
Comments throughout every file.
Buttons should include hover effects, and fields should clearly "focus" when in use.
Clean and professional creative styling.
