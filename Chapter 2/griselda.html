            <h2>Plot</h2>
            <p>The story follows Griselda Blanco, a powerful crime boss, and her rise in the Miami drug scene and pursuit of power and wealth. Drug use, paranoia, and betrayal lead to her downfall, with her actions resulting in multiple deaths, including that of a child.

Despite serving time in prison, tragedy strikes when most of her children are murdered. The series ends with Griselda imagining a peaceful beach scene with her children.

                        Netflix is genius to see the demands. Full movie is just too long and soap opera with 15-20 eps are as well, so they have these limited series with everything I could have wished for in a movie. From the casting, actors, sound & music, videography, production, clothing and more. 
                        The character development is crazy, it was done slowly where it needs with no unnecessary part. </p>

                        The first 10 seconds with the quote from Pablo Escobar drew me in. Set the tone for the series. Vergara shows off her incredible versatility with this crime drama role that she absolutely excels in. The dialogue is well written, and it captures the relationship she has with her kids as well as countless surrounding male characters. Pilot episode has Blanco navigate her new home in Miami, and her fearlessness in this pilot sets up her motivations and concerns for herself and her family.</p>

                        This is the stuff that makes the Netflix subscription worth paying for. This 6 ep series is one nice gripping movie from start to finish. The entire production is better than a top end Mercedes with all the bells & whistles. It has the ingredients of an amazing 6 course meal coungered up by your very best fantasy Chef. Its fast, steady, gripping, gritty fab film sets music and totally believable plus sexy and sad.</p>

                        Sofia Vergara did an incredible job at playing Griselda on the Netflix Series titled “Griselda” plus she was Executive Producer so I tip my hat to her. The casting and script depicting certain characters in the story line were not realistic. For instance the scene portraying Jon Roberts was definitely not realistic.</p>

                        Having lived in Miami throughout that era, I believe the film 100% captures what it was like living it. I like that it is not "documentarish" and that in fact Vergara did not look like the real Griselda. It delivered the feel of what was going on with a larger twist. Colombian women of that era involved in the "trade" were classy looking and fancy.</p>

                        Shoutout to Sophia Vergara for showing everyone that she’s an excellent actor and a talent to reckon with. She immersed herself into this role and it clearly shows. I never knew she was such a good actor and I’m pleasantly surprised. Hoping she gets more roles like this to show her talent. I’d never heard of Griselda Blanco before so I watched the show with lowered expectations but was happy with the outcome.</p>

                        Griselda is a great series, with brilliant performances, and tried to show a cruel woman, in her facet as a mother and most importantly, as in many environments women have had to suffer mistreatment for the fact of being one. This film shows how, once again, the history has been contacted from the male point of view. It is incredible that this story was not sufficiently known and how the genius and her spirit of self-improvement took her so far.</p>

                        The timeline is off, it follows the same old corny TV telling of gangster films, well at least the bad ones and most of all I can’t take it seriously because of the ridiculous makeup! Griselda didn’t have ugly brown teeth highlighted by doodoo brown lipstick (she always wore reddish-pink) and what’s with the overtly audacious elf nose that looks more like Gonzo than Griselda ever did? Seriously! Griselda was not an ugly woman.</p>

                        Netflix gives only three categories to rate movies or series: Not for me. I like this. I love this. My vote was "Not for me" not because the production, direction or performances. I didn't like it because Colombia has been working really hard to forget that horrible past. Sofia Vergara should spend all of her money in some positive, instructional, cultural or at least funny series.</p>

                        While the show was indeed entertaining, it left me yearning for a more elaborate portrayal. As someone who has delved deeply into Griselda's story over the years, I found that significant aspects were either left untold or merely glossed over. The show should have delved into the depths of her lunacy, showcasing her penchant for beheadings and the macabre practice of mailing heads to her adversaries.</p>
